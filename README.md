# ImageSequence
###### A small JS tool to easily perform operations on image sequence.

## How it works
Quite simple :
- include ImageSequence.js to your HTML (or the minified one...)
- instantiate a new ImageSequence
- use methode to control your player (99% of the case just need instance.to( index ) )
